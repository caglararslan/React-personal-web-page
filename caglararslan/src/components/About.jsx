                    I graduated from NamÄ±k Kemal University in 2021 by completing computer engineering.I dealt with many projects during my student years. I started my working life as a front-end developer while still a student. 
                    I am very happy to do the job I love, my biggest goal is to add great value to the projects I take part in by constantly improving myself.
